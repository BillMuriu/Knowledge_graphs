“The Day You Became a Better Writer” by Scott Adams
Even though I am a very good writer and I’ve been writing a
lot since I was young, I still open up that blog post and put it
in the background anytime I’m writing anything important.
It’s that good. I use it as my basic template for how to write
well. Think about the title, “The Day You Became a Better
Writer.” It’s such a powerful title. He teaches you in one small
blog post the importance of surprise, the importance of head-
lines, the importance of being brief and directed, not using
some adjectives and adverbs, using active not the passive
voice, etc. This one blog post right there will change your
writing style forever if you put your ego down and absorb it
properly. [6]

Best post I’ve read on “Career Decisions” (in Silicon Valley/
tech) by @eladgil
Harari’s Sapiens in lecture/course form on YouTube.
Every business school should have a course on Aggregation
Theory. Or learn it from the master himself, @benthompson,
the best analyst in technology.
Great read. “Quantum physics is not ‘weird.’ You are weird.”—
“Think Like Reality” [Eliezer Yudkowsky]
Must-read. “Lazy Leadership” by @Awilkinson
No-holds-barred wisdom from a self-made man. Everything on
@EdLatimore’s site is worth reading for overachievers: https://
edlatimore.com/
If you eat, invest, and think according to what the “news”
advocates, you’ll end up nutritionally, financially, and
morally bankrupt.

NAVAL’S RECOMMENDED READING · 221

Art De Vany (on Facebook)
Genius is here, just unevenly distributed. [4]
Must-read. (Twitter thread on “intellectual compounding” by
@zaoyang). [11]
There are actually some really good graphic novels out there.
If you’re open to the cartoony element of it, Transmetropoli-
tan [Warren Ellis], The Boys [Garth Ennis], Planetary [Warren
Ellis], and The Sandman [Neil Gaiman]…some of these are, I
think, among the finest works of art of our age. I also grew
up as a boy reading comics, so I may be very biased toward
those. [1]
Rick and Morty (TV show + comic book)
Rick and Morty is the best show on television (IMHO, of course).
Just watch the first episode—that’s all it takes. It’s Back to the
Future meets The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
The Rick and Morty comic [by Zac Gorman] is just as clever
as the show.
“You and Your Research” by Richard Hamming
A beautiful essay, I highly recommend reading it. It’s ostensibly
written for people who are in scientific research, but I think it
applies across the board. It’s just an old-timer essay on how to
do great work. It reminds me of much of what Richard Feyn-
man used to say, although I think Hamming has put it more
eloquently than almost anywhere else I’ve seen. [74]
